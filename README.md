## Acknowledgement
The python code used to build the NLP model is modified from Tobias Sterbak's blog post on [Named Entity Recognition with BERT](https://www.depends-on-the-definition.com/named-entity-recognition-with-bert/). The training data used for finetuning the model is taken from Professor Olivetti's group's [Github Page](https://github.com/olivettigroup/materials-synthesis-generative-models).
